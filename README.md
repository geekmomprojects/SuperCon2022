# SuperCon2022
Documentation for the motion-reactive wearables workshop at SuperCon2022

* The motion-reactive wearables workshop takes place Saturday, Nov. 5 from 1:00 – 3:00 p.m. on the Supplyframe HQ 2nd floor. We’ll be assembling and coding motion-reactive LED headbands. All materials to make the headbands will be provided, but you will need to bring your own laptop or Chromebook for the coding portion. 

* For the coding, you will need to bring your own laptop with a USB port and WiFi. If you have your own preferred CircuitPython editor, then make sure it is installed on your laptop. If not, then please install a CircuitPython editor like Mu [https://codewith.mu/](https://codewith.mu/), which is what I’ll be using. Also please have or install a terminal emulator that you know how to use. I’ll be using Tera Term [](https://ttssh2.osdn.jp/index.html.en)

* The board we’re using is a Seeeduino XIAO nRF52840 Sense (https://www.seeedstudio.com/Seeed-XIAO-BLE-Sense-nRF52840-p-5253.html), which has an accelerometer, microphone and Bluetooth built in.  We’ll discuss/demonstrate using accelerometer data to determine movement and orientation, and how to incorporate that data into your own CircuitPython LED animations using Adafruit’s CircuitPython led_animation code library. If there is extra time, we’ll look at using microphone data in sound-reactive animations and using Bluetooth control to switch between animations. If there isn’t enough time to cover it all, there will be example code on GitHub for later review.

* You will not need the CircuitPython code in advance of the workshop, as it will be pre-loaded on the XIAO board you receive. After the workshop the full code will be posted on this GitHub
